Historie
Lean is a manufacturing philosophy based on reducing unneeded steps (wastes) from a production system; its roots can be found in the production system developed by automakers in Japan after the World War II. Its main ideas were conceptualized by Taiichi Ohno, Shigeo Shingo and Eiji Toyoda, in the now famous TOYOTA PRODUCTION SYSTEM (TPS) (Ohno, 1988), a system that comprehends philosophies and the best practices for automobile makers, including relations with its own workforce, customers and suppliers.

The term Lean started to be popular after the book “T HE M ACHINE THE WORLD THAT CHANGED (Womack, Jones, & Ros, 1991) the authors reviewed ninety auto assembly plants and uncovered the specific production techniques behinds Japan’s success, showing the gap of performance between the western and Japanese firms. Later on, in 1996, the publication of the book “LEAN THINKING ” (Womack & Jones, 1996) by the same authors distilled _five_ principles precursors of the Lean philosophy; its application could direct to the improvement of any process in virtually any industry sector.
